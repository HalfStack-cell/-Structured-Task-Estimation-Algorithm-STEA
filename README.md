#Structured Task Estimation Algorithm (STEA)
Description
The Structured Task Estimation Algorithm (STEA) is designed to streamline project planning by breaking down tasks into stages, analyzing complexity, and calculating the total time required for completion. This tool is particularly useful for software development projects, providing clear timelines and detailed breakdowns, optimizing project execution.

Features
Component Breakdown: Automatically divides a project into manageable stages.
Complexity Analysis: Evaluates the complexity of each component to estimate time requirements.
Time Estimation: Provides an accurate timeline for project completion based on complexity and scaling factors.
Detailed Breakdown: Offers a comprehensive overview of the time required for each stage of the project.
Installation
To use the STEA, clone the repository and ensure you have Python installed:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Structured-Task-Estimation-Algorithm.git
cd Structured-Task-Estimation-Algorithm
Usage
You can run the STEA by executing the stea.py script:

bash
Copy code
python stea.py
Example
When prompted, enter the number of components in your project, followed by the complexity level and time-scaling factor for each component. The algorithm will then calculate and display the total time required for the project, along with a detailed breakdown.
