#Structured Task Estimation Algorithm (STEA)

#Origin and Purpose
The Structured Task Estimation Algorithm (STEA) was initially designed as a critical component in multi-agent systems. It serves as a valuable tool for identifying and breaking down into concepts, softwares and objects of any other domain as manageable components. By doing so, STEA enhances the understanding, planning, and execution of tasks, regardless of their size and complexity. This makes it an indispensable asset in optimizing processes and ensuring successful project outcomes.


Description
The Structured Task Estimation Algorithm (STEA) is a versatile tool designed to streamline project planning and execution. Originally developed for multi-agent systems, STEA excels at breaking down complex tasks into manageable stages, analyzing their complexity, and calculating the total time required for completion. Whether applied to software development or other domains, STEA provides clear timelines, detailed breakdowns, and optimized execution strategies, making it invaluable for projects of any size and complexity.

Features
Component Breakdown: Automatically divides a project into manageable stages.
Complexity Analysis: Evaluates the complexity of each component to estimate time requirements.
Time Estimation: Provides an accurate timeline for project completion based on complexity and scaling factors.
Detailed Breakdown: Offers a comprehensive overview of the time required for each stage of the project.
Installation
To use the STEA, clone the repository and ensure you have Python installed:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Structured-Task-Estimation-Algorithm.git
cd Structured-Task-Estimation-Algorithm
Usage
You can run the STEA by executing the stea.py script:

bash
Copy code
python stea.py
Example
When prompted, enter the number of components in your project, followed by the complexity level and time-scaling factor for each component. The algorithm will then calculate and display the total time required for the project, along with a detailed breakdown.
